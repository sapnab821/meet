This meet app was created by CRA

The TDD technique is used so the meet app can work offline
User will be able to use the app when they want to view events that are upcoming for a specific city
The server is a serverless function hosted by a cloud provider (e.g.,
AWS). The application itself is also hosted online to make it shareable and installable. It can
be used even when the user is offline. As itâ€™s responsive, it displays well on any device.
Serverless is the next generation of cloud infrastructure, PWA provides great user
experience and performance, and the TDD technique ensures you have quality code and
adequate test coverage. All of these skills, together with data visualization, will distinguish
you from other web developers.

The Meet app will use AWS Lambda, which is serverless (Faas), for authorization. For the API the consumer key, the consumer secret and an access token are needed for authorization. The User will use the key and secret, which is essentially a username and password to grant access for the serverless function hosted on AWS Lambda to provide the access token. When the user grants access to Google calendar, the serverless function displays the events. The authorization sends back an access token which is used when the user is logged into the app.
